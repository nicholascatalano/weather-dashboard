# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This is a dashboard for checking the weather in any city using the OpenWeatherMap API found here: https://openweathermap.org/current. The goal was to be able to search for a city's current and 5 day forecast weather, which includes, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

#### Install
No install necessary; please visit nicholascatalano.github.io/weather-dashboard

#### Use
To use, please enter the name of a valid city in the search bar, then click the submit button. The current weather conditions should append to the right side of your screen, and below that the 5-day forecast.
